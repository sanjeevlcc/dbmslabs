 Introduction to Transaction Processing
==========================================================================


Transaction processing is a fundamental aspect of modern database systems, 
facilitating the reliable and efficient management of data in various 
applications. 

In this context, a transaction refers to a logical unit of work
that consists of one or more database operations, such as reads, writes,
or updates. 

These operations are typically performed as a single, indivisible unit 
to maintain data integrity and consistency.

Transaction processing systems (TPS) are responsible for 
executing and managing transactions in a reliable and efficient manner.

Transaction and System Concepts
==========================================================================

ACID
------

      Atomicity:
      ---------------
          Transactions should exhibit the atomicity property, meaning 
          that either all the operations within a transaction are 
          executed successfully, or none of them are. 
          
          In other words, transactions are indivisible and 
          should be treated as all or nothing.
      
      Consistency:
      ---------------
          Transactions should leave the database in a consistent 
          state, adhering to all integrity constraints and business rules. 
          Consistency ensures that the database transitions from one
          valid state to another valid state after each transaction.
      
      Isolation: 
      ---------------
          Each transaction should be isolated from other transactions
          executing concurrently. 
          
          Isolation ensures that the intermediate states of transactions
          are not visible to other transactions until they are committed. 
          This prevents interference and maintains data integrity.
      
      Durability: 
      ---------------
          Once a transaction is committed, its effects should be 
          permanently stored in the database and should not be lost, 
          even in the event of system failures. 
          
          Durability guarantees that committed transactions survive 
          system crashes or other failures.





==========================================================================
Desirable Properties of Transactions
==========================================================================

Desirable Properties of Transactions:
---------------------------------------------

ACID Properties: 
---------------
    The desirable properties of transactions are often 
    summarized using the acronym ACID:
    
    Atomicity: 
        Transactions are all-or-nothing operations.
    Consistency: 
        Transactions preserve the consistency of the database.
    Isolation: 
        Transactions execute independently of each other and do not interfere.
    Durability: 
        Committed transactions persist even in the face of system failures.

Concurrency Control:
------------------------------
    Effective concurrency control mechanisms are essential for
    managing concurrent execution of transactions while preserving
    consistency and isolation. 
    
    Techniques such as locking, timestamp ordering, and multi-version 
    concurrency control are commonly employed to ensure correct interleaving
    of transactions.

Recovery Management: 
------------------------------
    Robust recovery mechanisms are necessary to restore the database to
    a consistent state after system failures. 
    
    This involves techniques such as logging changes to the database,
    maintaining a write-ahead log, and performing recovery procedures 
    such as rollbacks or roll-forwards.

High Availability: 
------------------------------
    Transaction processing systems should aim to achieve high 
    availability to ensure continuous access to data and
    uninterrupted operation, even in the face of hardware 
    failures, network issues, or other disruptions. 
    
    Redundancy, failover mechanisms, and disaster recovery plans 
    contribute to achieving high availability.

Scalability: 
------------------------------
    Transaction processing systems should be designed to scale 
    efficiently to handle increasing workloads and growing datasets. 
    
    Scalability can be achieved through techniques such as sharding, 
    replication, and vertical or horizontal scaling of hardware resources.
